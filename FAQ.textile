h1. 101 browser FAQ

h3. Where does the name "101 browser" come from?

Originally I called my browser project "x^2+1" (I like naming my project after mathematical objects). Where does this strange name come from. Consider the field of real numbers R. As you learn in any introductory course about abstract algebra for this field there exists (up to isomorphism) only one algebraic field extension, which is isomorphic to R[x]/&lt;x^2+1&gt;, where &lt;x^2+1&gt; -- of course -- denotes the ideal generated by x^2+1.

This field extension is -- of course -- isomorphic to the field of complex numbers.

If you look back into mathematical history the discovery of the complex numbers lead to a mathematical breakthroughs. I only say "fundamental theorem of algebra" and "complex analysis" (which is a lot more elegant than "standard calculus"). Since I think browser technology needs a radical breakthrough of disruptive changes I found it a fitting name. ;-)

Unluckily the project server of the university which I used at the beginning did not like the ^ character in its name -- so I were requested to change the project name. Since I wanted to preserve the spirit of the name I chose the coefficient order of the polynomial x^2+1 which obviously is 1, 0, 1 and renamed it to 101 browser.

h3. What does the "MTAx" namespace mean?

Since 101 is not a valid namespace name, I used MTAx, which is 101 encoded in Base64.
