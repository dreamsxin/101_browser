System requirements:
    Operation system: Windows XP/Server 2003/Vista/Server 2008/7 (only tested under XP, but the other ones should work)
There is *no* proper Linux port (sorry for the inconvenience, I'm working on it)
There is *no* Mac port (and *none* is planned at the moment; if Apple is willing to donate a Mac, I'll think about reconsidering)
    For building on Windows: Visual Studio 2008
    For building on Linux: gcc, cmake
Description: A small web browser (or more precise: a small yet-to-become web browser)
Building: For Windows use the 101_browser.sln file in the root folder.
For the experimental Linux port, type (without the "$ ").
$ cmake .
$ make
