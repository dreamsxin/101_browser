System requirements:
    Operation system: Windows XP/Server 2003/Vista/Server 2008/7 (only tested under XP, but the other ones should work)
    Current Linux (I'm only testing under the current Ubuntu (10.4 at the moment). Note that the Linux port is sometimes a little behind the Windows version. :-(
There is *no* port to crApple MacOS X (and *none* is planned at the moment; if crApple is willing to donate a Mac, I'll think about reconsidering)
    For building on Windows: Visual Studio 2008/2010 (the former is recommended). Note that under Visual Studio 2008 you additionally need to have Boost installed.
    For building on Linux: gcc, scons
Description: A small web browser (or more precise: a small yet-to-become web browser)
Building: For Windows use the 101_browser_vs2008.sln/101_browser_vs2010.sln file in the root folder.
For the experimental Linux port, type (without the "$ ").
$ scons
