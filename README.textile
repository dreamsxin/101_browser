h2. 2. System requirements

h3. 2.1 Operation System

h4. 2.1.1 Windows

Windows Vista/Server 2008/7/Server 2008 R2 (currently only tested under Windows 7, but the other ones should work). 

Note that not all parts of 101_browser will work under Windows XP or older, because some parts are using APIs that were introduced with Vista to simplify the code or add features.

In other words: better don't attempt to get 101_browser to tun on Windows XP or older. It will save you frustration.

h4. 2.1.2 Linux

An up-to-date Linux distribution (I'm only testing under the most current Ubuntu (11.10 at the moment)).

h4. 2.1.3 Other Operation Systems

There is *no* port to MacOS X (and *none* is planned at the moment, since I don't own a mac and I'm not willing to get one).

h3. 2.2 Required software for building

h4. 2.2.1 Windows

Visual Studio 2010.

h4. 2.2.2 Linux

gcc, g++, scons, XLib

h2. 3. Building

h3. 3.1 Windows

Use the 101_browser_vs2010.sln file in the root folder.

h3. 3.2 Linux

Type on your prompt (without the '$ '):

$ scons
