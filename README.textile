h2. 2. System requirements

h3. 2.1 Operation System

h4. 2.1.1 Windows

Windows XP/Server 2003/Vista/Server 2008/7 (only tested under XP, but the other ones should work)

h4. 2.1.2 Linux

Current Linux (I'm only testing under the current Ubuntu (10.4 at the moment)

h4. 2.1.3 Other Operation Systems

There is *no* port to crApple MacOS X (and *none* is planned at the moment; if crApple is willing to donate a Mac, I'll think about reconsidering).

h3. 2.2 Required software for building

h4. 2.2.1 Windows

Visual Studio 2008/2010 (the former is strongly recommended since I don't do regular updates of the Visual Studio 2010 projects at the moment).

h4. 2.2.2 Linux

g++, scons, XLib

h2. 3. Building

h3. 3.1 Windows

Use the 101_browser_vs2008.sln/101_browser_vs2010.sln file in the root folder.

h3. 3.2 Linux

Type on your prompt (without the '$ '):

$ scons
