h2. 2. System requirements

h3. 2.1 Operation System

h4. 2.1.1 Windows

Windows Vista/Server 2008/7 (currently only tested under Windows 7, but the other ones should work). Note that not all parts of 101_browser will work under Windows XP or older, because some parts are using APIs that were introduced with Vista to simplify the code or add features.

In other words: don't even attempt to get it to tun on Windows XP or older. It will spare you frustration.

h4. 2.1.2 Linux

An up-to-date Linux distribution (I'm only testing under the most current Ubuntu (10.10 at the moment)).

h4. 2.1.3 Other Operation Systems

There is *no* port to crApple MacOS X (and *none* is planned at the moment; if crApple is willing to donate a Mac, I'll think about reconsidering).

h3. 2.2 Required software for building

h4. 2.2.1 Windows

Visual Studio 2008/2010.

At the moment it is not obvious which one is better to choose: on the one hand I'm currently working 
with VS 2010 and don't update the VS 2008 solutions regularly anymore. On the other hand not all projects have been ported
to the new version. At least for beginners VS 2010 should be the better choice.

h4. 2.2.2 Linux

gcc, g++, scons, XLib

h2. 3. Building

h3. 3.1 Windows

Use the 101_browser_vs2008.sln/101_browser_vs2010.sln file in the root folder.

h3. 3.2 Linux

Type on your prompt (without the '$ '):

$ scons
