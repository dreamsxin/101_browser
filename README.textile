Current Linux (I'm only testing under the current Ubuntu (10.4 at the moment)

h3. Other Operation Systems

There is *no* port to crApple MacOS X (and *none* is planned at the moment; if crApple is willing to donate a Mac, I'll think about reconsidering).

h2. 2.2 Required software for building

h3. 2.2.1 Windows

Visual Studio 2008/2010 (the former is recommended since I don't do regular updates of the Visual Studio 2010 projects at the moment). 

When using Visual Studio 2008 (this does *not* apply when using Visual Studio 2010): a current version of Boost

Type on your prompt (without the '$ '):

$ scons
