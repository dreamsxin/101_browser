\chapter{FAQ}

\paragraph{What will make 101\_browser special?}

There are lots of existing browsers around. Why would you need another one?
\begin{itemize}
\item Current web browsers tend to get optimized for consuming and not for adding abilities to hack or reverse-engineer websites. Especially in areas of analyzing downloaded binary files (most browsers rely on external libraries there). So there is a gap to fill.
\item Wolfgang Keller does not believe that the browser vendors put enough emphasis on security and privacy. It is planned (if time allows) to do correctness proofs of critical parts. Additionally sometimes it is approved to risk security holes for compliance with outdated websites (for example: content negotiation or cross-side Javascript). 101\_browser will break standards in these cases (but in a very well-documented way, so that web developers won't have to fear of "`another browser hell"')
\item Many different standards (HTML+JS, PDF, SWF) tend to converge in delivered features. Why not write the browser as a unified runtime engine for all of them?
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Where does the name "`101\_browser"' come from?}

Originally Wolfgang Keller called the browser project "`x\^{}2+1"' (he likes naming his projects after mathematical objects -- especially at this time). Where does this strange name come from?

Consider the field of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. As you learn in any introductory course about abstract algebra for this field there exists (up to isomorphism) only one non-trivial algebraic field extension, which is isomorphic to $^{\mathbb{R}[x]}/_{\left\langle x^2+1\right\rangle}$, where $\left\langle x^2+1\right\rangle$ -- of course -- denotes the ideal generated by $x^2+1$.

This field extension is -- of course -- isomorphic to the field of complex numbers.

If you look back into mathematical history the discovery of the complex numbers lead to a mathematical breakthroughs. I only say "`fundamental theorem of algebra"' and "`complex analysis"' (which is a lot more elegant than "`standard calculus"' ;-) ). Since I think browser technology needs a radical breakthrough of disruptive changes Wolfgang Keller found it a fitting name. ;-)

Unluckily the project server of the university which he used at the beginning did not like the \^{} character in its name -- so he was requested to change the project name. Since he wanted to preserve the spirit of the name he chose the coefficient order of the polynomial $x^2+1$ which obviously is 1, 0, 1 and renamed it to 101\_browser.

\paragraph{What does the "`MTAx"' namespace mean?}

Since "`101"' is not a valid namespace in C++, "`MTAx"' was used, which is "`101"' encoded in Base64.

\chapter{Principles of 101\_browser}

\section{Avoid lookup tables}

Although some algorithms can be made faster by using lookup tables, we try to avoid to make use of them since they add additional complexity.

\section{Use as few additional libraries as possible}

For many features there are existing libraries. But in 101\_browser we avoid to make use of them. Why?

\begin{itemize}
\item You never know how well they are maintained
\item It is a goal of 101\_browser to provide an \emph{independent} implementation of web standards (this implies that it hopefully doesn't have \emph{the same} security bugs as in the commonly used implementation)
\item Since it should be easy to add support for experimental features, we can make our own implementation very similar in style -- this makes them easier to learn if you have already read into other parts of the source code
\end{itemize}

So: when is it OK to use an existing library?
\begin{itemize}
\item It has to be cross-platform
\item It has to be widely used
\item If it is an abstration of platform-specific details it should be the most low-level abstration that is available
\end{itemize}
At the time of writing (26th of December 2010) only the Standard library of C/C++ and OpenGL are accepted in this topic. Despite zlib is still used, it is planned to replace it by an own implementation soon.

\subsubsection{SHA-1 and SHA-2}

\paragraph{Where can I get information concerning SHA-1 and SHA-2?}
\begin{itemize}
\item FIBS 180-3: \verb|http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-3/fips180-3_final.pdf|
\item RFC 3174: \verb|http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3174.html|
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Graphics}

\subsubsection{GIF}

\paragraph{Where can I find the specification of GIF files?}
Look at \\
\verb|http://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif87.txt| (GIF87A) and \\
\verb|http://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt| (GIF89A).

\subsubsection{JPEG}

\paragraph{Where can I get the ITU-T T.81 standard?} Under \verb|http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/| there is a link to \verb|http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf|

\paragraph{Where can I get the ITU-T T.83 standard?} The authors of 101\_browser are not aware of a costless way that they are sure to be legal. So you will either have to pay or be on your own. :-(

Hint for adventurous people who don't fear legal consequences: search engines are a great invention. ;-)

\paragraph{Where can I obtain the test vectors for ITU-T T.83?} Under \\
\verb|http://www.itu.int/net/itu-t/sigdb/speimage/Tseries-s.htm|
there is a link to
\verb|http://www.itu.int/net/itu-t/sigdb/speimage/ImageForm-s.aspx?val=1010083|
where you can get the test vectors.
